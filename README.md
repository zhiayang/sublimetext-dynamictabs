# Dynamic Tab Insertion

The sublime text 3 version of the [VSCode plugin](https://github.com/zhiayang/vscode-tabindentspacealign)

works the same, but no configuration. upward line search is 0, indent based on preceding line is true,
and extra indent is 1 (and it looks for `,` and `:` in addition to `{').
